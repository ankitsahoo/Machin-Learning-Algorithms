#### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is used when the model is trained on data without labels (only inputs).

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**

- **What it does**: Groups similar data points into **k clusters**.
- **Example**: Segmenting customers into groups based on shopping habits (e.g., budget shoppers vs premium shoppers).

------

### 2. **Hierarchical Clustering**

- **What it does**: Builds a tree-like hierarchy of clusters.
- **Example**: Grouping movies based on genre, director, and ratings.

------

### 3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**

- **What it does**: Identifies clusters based on data density and ignores outliers.
- **Example**: Identifying high-density crime zones in a city.

------

### 4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

- **What it does**: Reduces the number of variables while retaining important information.
- **Example**: Simplifying a dataset with hundreds of features (e.g., genetics data) to find key patterns.

------

### 5. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**

- **What it does**: Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D by preserving relationships between points.
- **Example**: Visualizing patterns in customer reviews to identify sentiment trends.

------

### 6. **Autoencoders**

- **What it does**: Uses neural networks to compress and reconstruct data.
- **Example**: Detecting fraudulent transactions by identifying unusual patterns.

------

### 7. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**

- **What it does**: Assumes data is generated from a mix of Gaussian distributions and clusters it probabilistically.
- **Example**: Identifying speaker voices in an audio recording.

------

### 8. **Isolation Forest**

- **What it does**: Detects anomalies by isolating data points that differ significantly from the rest.
- **Example**: Detecting unusual credit card transactions.

------

### 9. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**

- **What it does**: A type of neural network that clusters and reduces data dimensions.
- **Example**: Organizing customer purchase patterns to create a map of product preferences.
