### **Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning is when the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).

### 1. **Linear Regression**

- **What it does**: Predicts continuous values.
- **Example**: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of bedrooms.

### 2. **Logistic Regression**

- **What it does**: Used for binary classification (yes/no).
- **Example**: Predicting whether an email is spam or not.

### 3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

- **What it does**: Finds the best boundary (hyperplane) to separate classes.
- **Example**: Classifying handwritten digits as 0-9.

### 4. **Decision Trees**

- **What it does**: Splits data into branches based on conditions.
- **Example**: Deciding whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on age, income, and credit score.

### 5. **Random Forest**

- **What it does**: Combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
- **Example**: Predicting the likelihood of rainfall based on weather data.

### 6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

- **What it does**: Classifies based on the majority class of nearby data points.
- **Example**: Recommending movies based on your friends' preferences.

### 7. **Naive Bayes**

- **What it does**: Uses probabilities to classify data.
- **Example**: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on past behavior.

### 8. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**

- **What it does**: Builds a strong model by combining many weak ones.
- **Example**: Predicting customer churn (whether they'll stop using a service).

### 9. **XGBoost**

- **What it does**: A faster and optimized version of GBM.
- **Example**: Winning Kaggle competitions by improving prediction speed and accuracy.

### 10. **LightGBM**

- **What it does**: A faster gradient boosting algorithm for large datasets.
- **Example**: Predicting stock prices in real-time.

### 11. **CatBoost**

- **What it does**: Handles categorical features efficiently in boosting.
- **Example**: Predicting loan default based on customer demographics like gender, job type, and marital status.
